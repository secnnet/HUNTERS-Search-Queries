--The AQL (Analytical Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to query databases in the IBM Security QRadar SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

--The queries you provided are selecting data from different tables in the ICON_EU_DB.RAW database schema that store information related to security events and logs generated by different Cisco security products, such as AMP (Advanced Malware Protection), ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance), FTD (Firepower Threat Defense), and Umbrella DNS.

--Each query is retrieving the first ten rows of data from the specified table, using the "Limit 10" clause. This allows the user to quickly preview the data and check for any potential issues or anomalies. These queries may be used for various purposes such as monitoring and investigating security incidents, analyzing network traffic, or generating reports.
