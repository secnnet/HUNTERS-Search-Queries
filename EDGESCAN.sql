--The AQL stands for ArangoDB Query Language, which is a query language used for managing data stored in ArangoDB databases.

--The first query you provided is retrieving data from the "EDGESCAN_HOSTS" collection in the "RAW" database in the "SECNNET_ASIA_JAPAN" database instance. The "SELECT *" statement indicates that all columns in the collection will be retrieved, while the "LIMIT 10" statement limits the number of results to 10. Therefore, this query will return the first 10 records from the "EDGESCAN_HOSTS" collection.

--The second query you provided is retrieving data from the "EDGESCAN_VULNERABILITIES" collection in the "RAW" database in the "SECNNET_ASIA_JAPAN" database instance. Similar to the first query, the "SELECT *" statement indicates that all columns in the collection will be retrieved, while the "LIMIT 10" statement limits the number of results to 10. Therefore, this query will return the first 10 records from the "EDGESCAN_VULNERABILITIES" collection.

--Overall, both queries are selecting and returning data from two different collections in the "RAW" database in the "SECNNET_ASIA_JAPAN" instance, and limiting the results to the first 10 records.
