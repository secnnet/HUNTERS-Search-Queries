--The AQL queries shown above are used to retrieve data from various tables within a database named "ICON_EU_DB". The database seems to store data related to Microsoft Azure Active Directory, as evidenced by the table names starting with "AZURE_" and containing terms such as "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_USERS", "ACTIVITY", "AUDIT", and "SIGNIN".

--Each query is similar in structure, with the "SELECT" statement indicating that all columns (*) should be retrieved from the specified table. The "FROM" clause specifies the database and table to retrieve the data from, and the "LIMIT" clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned to 10.

--These queries may be used to retrieve a sample of data from each of the four tables, possibly for the purpose of analysis or reporting.
