--The provided code is written in SQL, which is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

--The first SQL query selects all columns (indicated by the asterisk symbol) from the "QUALYS_HOST_DETECTIONS" table in the "ICON_EU_DB.RAW" database schema. The "Limit 10" clause limits the result set to the first 10 rows of data returned by the query.

--The "QUALYS_HOST_DETECTIONS" table likely contains information about security-related detections and vulnerabilities identified on specific hosts or devices, such as IP addresses or servers, using the Qualys vulnerability management tool. The query is retrieving the first 10 rows of this data for further analysis or display.

--The second SQL query selects all columns from the "QUALYS_KNOWLEDGEBASE" table, also in the "ICON_EU_DB.RAW" database schema, and limits the result set to the first 10 rows. The "QUALYS_KNOWLEDGEBASE" table likely contains information about known vulnerabilities and threats, along with recommendations for how to mitigate them, as documented by Qualys. The query is retrieving the first 10 rows of this data for further analysis or display.
