--The given code consists of three separate SQL queries, each selecting all columns from different tables and returning a limited number of rows (10 rows in this case).

--The queries are selecting data from the "ICON_EU_DB" database, specifically from the "RAW" schema and three different tables named "CROWDSTRIKE_DETECTS", "CROWDSTRIKE_DEVICES", and "CROWDSTRIKE_RAW_EVENTS".

--The purpose of these queries is to retrieve the data stored in these tables, which likely contain information related to CrowdStrike security detections, devices, and raw events. However, without more context about the application and purpose of these queries, it is difficult to determine their exact function.
