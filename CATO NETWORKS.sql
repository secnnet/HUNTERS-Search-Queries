--The given code is written in SQL and consists of multiple SELECT statements that retrieve data from different tables in a database.

--The database being accessed is ICON_EU_DB, and the tables being queried are RAW.CATO_NETWORKS_CONNECTIVITY_EVENTS, RAW.CATO_NETWORKS_ROUTING_EVENTS, RAW.CATO_NETWORKS_SECURITY_EVENTS, and RAW.CATO_NETWORKS_SOCKETS_MANAGEMENT_EVENTS.

--The SELECT statement with the LIMIT 10 clause at the end retrieves the first 10 rows of data from each table. This is useful when dealing with large databases and wanting to preview the data without having to retrieve the entire table.

--In summary, the code is retrieving the first 10 rows of data from each of the four tables mentioned above in the ICON_EU_DB database.
