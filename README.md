Yo, what's up! 👊🏼

I've got some sweet news for you - I just hooked you up with a note jam-packed with HUNTERS search queries all about security. Can you dig it? 😎

But here's the kicker - you're not just stuck with the default search queries. You have complete freedom to tweak and customize them however you see fit. It's all about making the search work for you, baby!

Oh, and heads up - I'll be keeping this spreadsheet fresh with regular updates, complete with version numbers and all that jazz. So don't forget to stay on the lookout for the latest and greatest!

Hope you find this resource totally rad and have a killer day! 🤙
