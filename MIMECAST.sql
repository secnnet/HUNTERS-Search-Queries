--The AQL (Asterix Query Language) is a query language used for processing large amounts of data in a distributed system, such as Apache AsterixDB.

--The queries listed appear to be selecting data from different tables within a database called ICON_EU_DB, specifically tables related to logs generated by the email security platform Mimecast.

--Each query uses the SELECT statement to specify which columns to retrieve (in this case, using the wildcard character * to select all columns), and the LIMIT statement to restrict the number of rows returned to 10.

--It's likely that these queries are being used for data analysis or troubleshooting purposes, to investigate the behavior of the email security platform, or to identify patterns or anomalies in the logs.
