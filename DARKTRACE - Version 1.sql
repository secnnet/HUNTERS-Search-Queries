--The statements you provided are SQL (Structured Query Language) queries, which are used to retrieve data from relational databases.

--Each of these queries is selecting all columns (*) from a specific table within the "SECNNET_ASIA_JAPAN" database schema, which is "RAW.DARKTRACE_AI_ANALYST", "RAW.DARKTRACE_AUDIT", and "RAW.DARKTRACE_MODEL_BREACHES", respectively.

--The "Limit 10" at the end of each query limits the number of rows returned to 10, allowing you to quickly see a small sample of the data in each table.

--In summary, these queries are retrieving the first 10 rows of data from three different tables within the "SECNNET_ASIA_JAPAN" database schema: "DARKTRACE_AI_ANALYST", "DARKTRACE_AUDIT", and "DARKTRACE_MODEL_BREACHES".
